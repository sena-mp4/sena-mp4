## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm a Front-End developer in training, focused on building clean, responsive and accessible web interfaces using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

I'm currently learning React and improving my skills in version control with Git. I believe in writing clean, well-structured code and creating user experiences that feel simple and intuitive.

I started studying web development in 2024 and have since built personal projects to apply what I learn ‚Äî from layout replications to interactive components.

I enjoy pixel art, retro games, and learning about design.
